# Wing Commander Browser Game

A modern web browser recreation of the legendary space combat game Wing Commander 1, using JavaScript and WebGL.

## Project Overview

This project aims to recreate the classic 1990 space combat simulator Wing Commander 1 as a browser-based game, maintaining the core gameplay elements and narrative structure while modernizing the graphics and controls for web browsers.

Wing Commander revolutionized space combat games with its cinematic presentation, branching story, character development, and accessible gameplay. Our goal is to preserve these core elements while making the game accessible to modern players without requiring emulation.

## Game Features to Implement

- **3D Space Combat**: Recreate the dogfighting combat system with multiple enemy ship types
- **Mission Structure**: Implement the branching mission system based on performance
- **Wingman System**: Include AI wingmen that can receive commands
- **Narrative Elements**: Recreate the between-mission narrative scenes and character interactions
- **Ship Systems**: Implement damage systems, shield management, and weapons systems
- **Kilrathi Adversaries**: Create multiple enemy types with distinct AI behaviors
- **Carrier Operations**: Include takeoff and landing sequences from the carrier

## Technology Stack

After thorough research, we've selected the following technologies:

- **Babylon.js**: For 3D rendering and game engine functionality
  - More complete game engine features compared to Three.js
  - Built-in physics system for realistic space flight
  - Better support for complex scenes and game-specific features
  - Active community and documentation

- **Web Audio API**: For sound effects and music
- **Modern JavaScript (ES6+)**: For game logic and systems
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: For UI elements and menus
- **LocalStorage/IndexedDB**: For saving game progress
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Specifically the Puppeteer MCP for testing and UI development

- [x] Implement branching mission paths based on performance
- [x] Create carrier landing/takeoff sequences
- [x] Design and implement HUD and cockpit view
- [x] Add shield and energy management systems
- [x] Implement communication system with wingmen

### Phase 4: Content Creation (3 weeks)
- [x] Model and texture all spacecraft (Confederation and Kilrathi)
- [x] Create space environments and backgrounds
- [x] Design mission scenarios mirroring the original game
- [x] Create simplified versions of narrative cutscenes
- [x] Implement character portraits and dialogue system

### Phase 5: UI and Progression (2 weeks)
- [ ] Create main menu and game options
- [ ] Implement save/load system
- [ ] Add mission briefing and debriefing screens
- [ ] Create medal and promotion system
- [ ] Design and implement pilot statistics tracking

### Phase 6: Audio and Polish (2 weeks)
- [ ] Add sound effects for weapons, engines, and UI
- [ ] Implement background music system
- [ ] Add visual effects (explosions, engine trails, etc.)
- [ ] Optimize performance for various devices
- [ ] Fix bugs and refine gameplay

### Phase 7: Testing and Release (2 weeks)
- [ ] Conduct thorough testing across different browsers
- [ ] Fix compatibility issues
- [ ] Balance difficulty and gameplay
- [ ] Prepare documentation for players
- [ ] Launch initial public release

## Technical Implementation Details

### Spacecraft Physics
We'll implement a hybrid physics system that maintains the fun arcade-style feel of the original while adding some modern improvements:
- Simplified Newtonian physics with dampening for intuitive control
- Angular velocity limitations to prevent excessive spinning
- Afterburner system for speed boosts

### AI System
- State machine-based AI for enemy craft
- Different behavior patterns for various Kilrathi ships
- Wingman AI with command response system
- Difficulty scaling based on mission progress

### Rendering Approach
- Babylon.js PBR materials for realistic spacecraft
- Optimization techniques for multiple ships in combat
- Level of detail adjustments for distant objects
- Custom shaders for space environments and effects

### Mission System
- JSON-based mission definition format
- Event-driven mission progression system
- Scoring system based on objectives and performance
- Branching path logic based on mission outcomes

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/BenPomme/wingcommander.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd wingcommander

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## MCP Server Setup for Development

To enhance development and testing capabilities, we'll use Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers:

```bash
# Install Puppeteer MCP for UI testing and automation
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer

# Run the MCP server (in a separate terminal)
npx @modelcontextprotocol/server-puppeteer
```
